# My Personal Website 🌟

Welcome to my personal website! This is a simple project I created for fun and learning.

The website contains:
- A short introduction about me
- A collection of blogs that I have published

## 🌐 Website Structure

The website has two main sections:
1. **Introduction Page** - Where I talk a little bit about myself.
2. **Blog Section** - Where you can find my personal blog posts.
